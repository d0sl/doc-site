Theory of algorithms was created by Alan Turing as a part of effort of Allies during WWII to crack Nazi's Enigma code using so called computers. Computers can understand only exact sets of infrustrions explaining how to solve the problem. Such sets of instructions are called _algorithms_ of _computer programs_. 

But we humans in our every day life use logic in our language. Regular person could hardly remember all the  instructions even for the washing machine. So we have special people who can do a translation between us humans and computers, which are called _software developers_ or _programmers_. But the problem is that even after more than 70 year history of computers we still have less than **1% of population** who can do such job.

_Algorithms_ give computers an exact set of instructions on _how_ to solve the problem. In order to create such _algorithm_ you need to perform certain steps:

1. Specify the problem in a manner, which excludes uncertainties. Such specifications should have _rigid_ and _logical_ form.
2. Give it to programmers 
3. Eventually after several technological steps (such as architecture, OO design, etc) programmers convert the specification into a _program_ written in some of _programming languages_ 
4. Such program can now be translated into a _machine code_ and executed on a computer.

This means that everytime we need to make computers to do something we have to have a computer program, which can be created only by software developers **manually**. Manual work as everybody knows involves human errors. So **#1 problem** is the **Quality** of software programs written by humans. Software _bugs_ can kill any good intention.

The more programs we need, the more software developers will be involved. The more computers are used by humanity, the more programs we need, and even more developers will be required. Introduction of _mobile phones_, _IoT_ and _Edge Computing_ into everyday life creates more and more demand for _programmers_. Don't forget that every mobile phone is a computer. And we want to put computer chips into _things_ like tea pots and fridges. 

Today we have more computers on the planet than humans. Think about this. Where are we going to get enough _software developers_ in the situation when number of computerized equipment grows much faster than numebr of developers. This **problem #2** -- we have **not enough programmers**.

And **problem #3** -- is that _mobile_ communications, _robots_, _edge computing_ and _Iot_ reiterates the problem of the quality: our civilization becomes more and more dependent on the **quality of computer programs**.
