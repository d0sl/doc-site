**Semantic modelling** is a technology allowing to solve those problems. This is how it works:

1. Developer or subject domain expert creates a specification of the application **logic** (_semantic model_) in `d0SL` language in `d0SDK` IDE.
2. Then `d0SDK` generates _java_ code of this _semantic model_
3. This semantic model's java code can now be executed on `d0VM` (delta 0 virtual machine)
