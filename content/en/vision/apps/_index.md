# ... and use cases


Please don't be delluded, semantic modelling is not a silver bullet. It won't allow to create _any_ program for non programmers. Semantic modelling helps to solve so called logical or discrete problems. For example, if you need to solve some specific heavy computational tasks (like neural networks, differential equations, etc)  you still need to do traditional programming. UI is still easier to be developed by humans. 

We see the following areas of applications for semantic modelling:

1. **Autonomous systems**. For example, semantic modelling is being used for many years by mobile telcos, and banks. 
2. **Business logic** and **workflow** process automation.
3. **Embedded** systems and **edge computing**.
4. **Industrial IoT**
5. **Robotics** and autonomous equipment
