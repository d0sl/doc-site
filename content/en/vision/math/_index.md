Originally the mathematical theory behind this technology was developed in [Sobolev Institute of Mathematics](http://math.nsc.ru) by three famous  mathematicians Yuri L. Yershov, Sergey S. Goncharov and Dmitry I. Sviridenko. 

So the idea behind **semantic modelling** is how to make it simpler for _non-programmers_ to communicate with computers. Instead of creating yet another algorithmic language for programming, semantic modelling is focusing on using _logical_ language allowing _non-programmers_ to effectively explain computers _what_ to do (opposed to algorithms describing _how_). Such _semantic models_ are called **executable specifications**.

`d0sl` stands for \\( \Delta_0 \\) (_delta zero_)Semanti—Å Language.

{{% notice tip %}}
- `d0sl` is a declarative executable specifications language, which is a constructive subset of the first order predicate logic language. 
- `d0sl` syntax [here]({{< ref "/d0sl/_index.md" >}})
