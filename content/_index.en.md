# Learn D0SL Semantic Platform

Our goal is to develop a platform for automatic decision making based on a semantic approach.

By the semantic approach, we understand that people will be able to describe the rules in a language of logic, language that everyone understands, and is quite simple to use. Language to exclude everything superfluous, and only the most important to remain.

Remember the three Laws of Robotics which govern the behaviour of Isaac Asimov's fictional Positronic Robots were formally stated by Asimov in his story "Runaround" (March 1942):{{% /notice %}}

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

This is exactly what we want to turn into reality!

Now there is a new industrial revolution. Neural networks drive a car instead of a person. Complex mechanisms and systems work longer and longer without human participation.

But there is a recognized problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Namely the black box problem. Even a neural network technician does not know what is going on inside.

Our project is to help humanity to control artificial intelligence, autonomous systems (or even business processes) by using understandable domain specific language and human logic.
