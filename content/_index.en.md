# Semantic approach

The goal of our project is to develop a platform for automatic decision making based on a semantic approach.

By the semantic approach, we understand that people will be able to describe the rules in a language of logic, language that everyone understands, and is quite simple to use. Language to exclude everything superfluous, and only the most important to remain.

Remember the three Laws of Robotics which govern the behaviour of Isaac Asimov's fictional Positronic Robots were formally stated by Asimov in his story "Runaround" (March 1942):{{% /notice %}}

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

This is exactly the semantic approach!

Now begins a new scientific and technological revolution. Neural networks drive a car instead of a person. Complex mechanisms are working longer and longer without human supervision.

But there is the black box problem. Even a neural network training specialist does not know what is going on inside it.

So our project is here to help control artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, or, for example, business processes and complex distributed transactions by using understandable domain specific language and human logic.
